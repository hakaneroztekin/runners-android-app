## Back story
I have developed the app during my first internship. I haven't had developed anything with Android before. Though, with self-study I was able to work on the initial versions of the app within the first week. I have completed the app within the first 2 weeks and then I've focused on improving the existing features and preparing documentation.

## Tools & Techs Used
**Software:** Java, Android Studio, C/C++, Arduino, JavaScript, Socket.io, WebStorm
**Hardware:** Bluno, soft sensors and microcontrollers

## Public Use
Unfortunately, the application is developed for a private project held by my faculty (Computer Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, Istanbul/Turkey). I have created this repository to share the insights and my work during my internship.
